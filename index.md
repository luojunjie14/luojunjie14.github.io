Hi! I am currently a Lecturer in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at Beijing Jiaotong University. Prior to this, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Nanyang Technological University under the supervision of Prof. Xiaohui Bei and a postdoctoral researcher at TU Berlin under the supervision of Prof. Rolf Niedermeier. I obtained my PhD in Operations Research and Cybernetics from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2019, where my advisor was Prof. Jinchuan Cui. I obtained my bachelor's degree from Zhejiang University in 2014, majoring in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics.
